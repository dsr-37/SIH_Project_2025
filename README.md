# SIH Project
## *By team: Crowd-Sync*

Developing a multi-platform project that on one hand enables citizens to capture and report civic issues like potholes, garbage spillage, faulty services etc with the click of a button, while on other hand equip municipal authorities with a streamlined dashboard to effectively look after, manage and resolve those issues.

## What We Have Built

- **Mobile App**: Easy-to-use interface for citizens to photograph and report civic issues
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time visualization tool for municipal staff to track and manage reports
- **Secure Access**: Implementing a secure authentication system for officials.
- **Backend**: Storing & Updating real-time reports from users using Firebase.

## What's Next?

- AI model that intelligently recognizes user provided description & converts it into a concise sendable one regardless of the text language or variety.
- An image classifier for analyzing the image that user is attaching on the report to only submit geniune queries and not some random stuff.
- Citizen engagement features like voting on issue importance.
- Implementing an automated routing engine to correctly allocate tasks to departments.
- Mobile app optimization for low-connectivity areas
- Other features are written on the SIH website but only feasible for the finale.
